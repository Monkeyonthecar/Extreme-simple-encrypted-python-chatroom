# Extreme-simple-encrypted-python-chatroom
A REALLY simple and easy to understand python chatserver. Could not find a very basic, simple to understand python encrypted chatroom on github( only found more complicated chatroom's with multiple files,libraries and functions, just not simple enough). So i created one myself.


Note: As the title says this code is made as simple as possible. It is for those who want a quick and easy to understand python encrypted chat server or for those who
are starting to get into cryptography (in python). This program is very limited and is only meant for simple texts (not for (big) files).
